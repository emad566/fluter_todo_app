A ToDo App using flutter 
-------------
A Flutter todo app typically works by allowing the user to create and manage a list of tasks or todos. Here's a basic overview of how it might work:

1. When the app is launched, it shows a list of previously saved tasks, if any.
2. The user can add a new task by tapping on a button or an input field to bring up a form.
3. In the form, the user can enter a task description and set its due date, priority level, and other details.
4. When the user submits the form, the app saves the new task to a database or a local storage.
5. The app updates the list of tasks to reflect the newly added task.
6. The user can edit or delete any existing task by tapping on it and selecting the appropriate action from a menu.
7. The app updates the list of tasks to reflect any changes made by the user.
8. The app may also provide additional features, such as sorting tasks by due date or priority level, filtering tasks by category or status, or notifying the user when a task is due.

Overall, a Flutter todo app relies on user input and data persistence to manage a list of tasks and provide a user-friendly interface for organizing and completing them.
